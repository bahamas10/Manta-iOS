Joyent Manta iOS Client
=======================

[Joyent Manta](http://www.joyent.com/products/manta) proof-of-concept iOS Client

Supports iOS >= 7.0

Usage
-----

Open `Manta.xcworkspace` and build for your iOS target

Note
----

I would consider this "barely functioning", and it is meant as nothing more than a proof-of-concept,
and maybe even hopefully a starting point for something bigger.
